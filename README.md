# my_top_five

A simple web app that allows users to list their favorite top five movies (single movie or series), books (single book or series), music (band or musician), and any other customizable categories they want (rappers? travel locations?).

Users will register using gmail sign in, and then they will be able to have a unique url generated that points to their Top Five list. They can put this url in their link in bio or link tree.
